# How to use
1. Download the entire folder to your computer
2. Run the ParticleFilter.py from the Codes folder
3. You may need to install Matplotlib and Numpy libraries on your computer
  Follow the steps from https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html and https://numpy.org/install/ 

4. ParticleFilter.py uses two other python files i.e. imageProcessing.py  and Simulation,py. So make sure to keep them in the same folder. 



# How does it work? 
First thing the code does is opens the image file.
